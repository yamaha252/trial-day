Create a responsive html page based on the design files found in the Design/Export folder.
Mobile and Desktop-Designs are given, tablets are up to your creativity.


Requirements:

  - Implement Fira Sans as base typo.
  - Adaptive page design is a minimum, for tablets please find your own design solution.
    We prefer fluid page design.
  - The bottom dark section with profiles should contain a slider. Other pages can be filled with dummy text.


Bonus:

  - Add icons and list elements via glyphicons-webfont.
  - If you have time add CSS-animations so that the content flies in or is shown in a cool way.
  
jQuery, bootstrap, SASS, GSAP and other similar libraries can be used.
You can also use the "css-mediaQueries.txt" if you like.
